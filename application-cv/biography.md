Hi my Name is Markus.
If the technologies i have worked with are not exactly exactly what you are looking for don't fret.
I learn fast and most concepts and technolgies/frameworks follow similar patterns and ways of doing things, looking back at my experiences.
Through working and experimenting with many different technolgies i have developed wide breadth
of skills and can understand the reasoning behind how programs & tools are constructed,
this speeds up transferring and adapting to new technologies significantly.
If your company is reserving a much time for adapting to the project/tech stack for me, 
then i think you would be surprised.
(If you really understand it you can transfer & adapt "knowledge")
