## IO types:
- In file --> Out Processed file (1/1 relationship)
- In multiple files -> Out processed file  (n/1 relationship)
- One file -> multiple processed files (1/n relationship)

Simplification: Only provide n/1 relationships through hierarchical means
-> there needs to be a parent -> converts it to 1/1 or 1/n relationships

## Processing levels/types:
- Application level 
    (perform all processing operations on a configured input)
- Directory level
    process a directory to output
- File level
    process a file to one or more output files
- Content/Data level
    process input content or data to output content
- Partial level
    process a part of the input content

Every processing type can be considered a pipeline!

## Templating:
typescript templates only.

### Types:
- Standalone: Can be combined with data and rendered as is:
```
<sample-component>
    <h1>My sample content of component</h1>
</sample-component>
```

```
<stack-view>
    <div class="container">
        <img></img>
        <div class="overlay"></div>
    </div>
</stack-view>
```
**stack-view** is a pseudo container that can modify
child contents (reverse elements, add class, permutate contents, add local style)


```
<mark-down>
    
    # This is a heading

    Lorem ipsum color aposf
    spdogp sodgk√º

</mark-down>
```

The markdown renderer is not something special but an actual template component
-> can be used with custom tag from <html>

Combination:
Can return template from template:
Resolve/Inflate template until no template is found anymore

```
render(){
    return `
        <mark-down>
            #something
        <mark-down>
    `
}
```

```njk
{{markdown}}

{{/markdown}}
```

```
<tags select="section">
    {{section}}
</tags>
```
Reference to rendered elements (multiple)

```
<tag-section>
    <mark-down>
        # Section title
    <mark-down>
    <tag-section-content />
</tag-section>
```
dynamic keyword renderers
In this case applies the

**Explicitly**
```html
    <each data="getRenderedTagCollection('section')">
        <mark-down>
            # Section title
        <mark-down>
        <section-component content="data" />
    </each>
```

``getRenderedTagCollection('section')`` is passed as data to the
'each' component (the data property should be for special cases only -> what we really want is to pass raw content into the components
can the parse/select the data we want need)

#### Example expandable FAQ list:
```
<listify>
    # What is SSP?
        Static site piplines is a simple site generator that can be adapted to any of your needs
        and follows as use as library, ultilitarian and modular approach, instead of being opinionated.
    # What else?
        Second list item expandable content
</listify>
```

#### The each component
```javascript
render(data, scope, dataProvider){
    const sectionList = []
    for (cont section of scope.data){

        render(data.content, scope = {
            'data': section
        })
    }
    return sectionList.join('\n')
}
```


```javascript
render(data, dataProvider){

    const renderedSections = dataProvider.getRenderedTagCollection('section')

    const sectionList = []
    for (cont renderedSection of renderedSections){
        sectionList.push(
            `
                <mark-down>
                    # Section title
                <mark-down>
                <section-component>
                    {{renderedSection}}
                </section-component>
            `
        )
    }
    return sectionList.join('\n')
}
```

HTML + component centric


``{{tag-content}}`` syntax is irrelevant when using
custom html tags, because writing ``<tag-content />`` is just the same amount of work


Components can have:
- No content (everything is inflated from explicitly passed data, or statically)
- Content that is placed within the component


## Should be isomorphic javascript:
- Static build time render 'nodejs'
- Default render on nodejs server (uses 'fs', 'chokidar', .etc)
- Renderer on client/browser (use cache or http requests to fetch templates/contents)

On demand renderer should be enabled by default, when not debugging (build page on request).
Dynamic rendering -> use it like a template engine with mutable data. (cache n page permutations or disable cache).


## Typescript template rendering should be portable
(move runtime + templates to different project/platform and start inflating)




# Render interface

Option1:
``render(data, scope, dataProvider)``
scope - contains current context:
- content - what is within the tag (if the content contains variables then this data should be passed in scope as well)
- dataProvider - service for side chaining data (example for global data that is not passed)
should this even be in render??

What does a component need in order to render:
- Content - optional what is passed between open and close tags
- Data scope - explicitly passed variables and data
- Sub renderers - renderers of any elements that are passed as content OR used in th render function.

#### Incremental rendering:
The main way to render subcomponents is to add the elements in the
resulting html.
Then the caller detects that there are unresolved components in the result,
finds the corresponding renderer and renders that partial.
Effectively the rendering is flip-flopping between the renderers and the caller and 
elements are incrementally refined.
-> the renderers do not need to know anything about other renderers apart from their tag name.
+ good for dynamic loading

``render(scope, content?)``

## Resolving urls, paths, .etc?

Options:

```html
<img src="{{ url-for /assets/img/testimg.jpg }}">

<img src="<url-for>/assets/img/testimg.jpg</url-for>">

<url-for>/assets/img/testimg.jpg</url-for>
<img src="url-for">

<url-for data-id='imgid'>/assets/img/testimg.jpg</url-for>
<img src="imgid">
```

I like the idea of having pseudo elements in the attributes for processing. (handlebars syntax looks a bit cleaner though)

2nd option is to locally bind the last pseudo element to a local scope variable that can be referenced.


### Even better
define a global attribute transformer function that maps all detected and existing input paths to output urls
that are not escaped in some way.

```
//Might contain components (as soon as it is encountered)
addAttributeTransformer(tag, attribute, (attributeValue, scope) => {
    if(hasRenderable(attributeValue)){
        render(attributeValue, scope)
    }
});

//Fully evaluated attribute (as soon as value is evaluated)
addRenderedAttributeTransformer(tag, attribute, (attributeValue, scope) => {
    return mapInputToOutputPath(attributeValue)
});

//Add pseudo component <url-for> to all
addAttributeTransformer('img,source,href', 'src', (attributeValue, scope) => {
    return wrapContent('url-for', attributeValue)
});
```

### 2. Incremental rendering
Inline data in html.
Each render pass creates a valid html.
- The first pass populates data
- The rest of the passes 




## Inplace site:
Paths to static resources are relative to the input directories
-> we could for development render the site in place with a dev server and not dynamically
resolve the output.
-> then in production map input dirs to output

Advantage: Site can be rendered without requiring global content (input and output dirs)


## Components
are somewhat similar to https://kinsta.com/blog/web-components/ ,
but have less features.
The reason for this is that web-components have quite a bit of boilerplate as they
also support dynamic features on the dom element itself (attribute watching)
Adding (template) content passed from the parent also has a lot of additional information.
(slots, slot names, templates, slotting in of content)

Transpiling nunchucks, liquid, or other templating languages to these component
is possible


# Processing graph
1. Input
    - directories to process
    - files to process
    - contents to process


Examples:
1. directories to process
2. Merge directories = single input directory
3. 



# Rendering features:
- Inheritance (extend and modify existing templates)
Implement njk, ejs, markdown, html or other renderers through inheritance (all treated as inherited renderers,
but are typescript layouts internally)
- Dynamic component
- Layout chain specification (specify the layout chain in content frontmatter -> img-gallery <- floating-box <- info-section )


### Rendering flow:
1. Markdown content
2. Parse to html
3. Decorate transform content 1:1 (bind content to proper structure and attributes) 'documentTransform'
Adding additional values into existing elements, adding containers for parts of the document.
Essentially merging two pieces together "content + structure/decoration"
4. Insert into any number of 'frames' or 'containers'

## Types of containers:
- leaf: self encapsulated container with no dependency on other layouts
- frames/containers: encapsulate the content
- child holder: encapsulate multiple children (list of sections, list of urls, .etc)
- content inflator: build multiple pieces of content from a single container (necessary??)


### What can be done with content:
- Wrap content into container
- parse and transform content
- decorate content with other content
- split content into multiple pieces of content
- merge multiple pieces of content and containers, .etc

### Prevent parseland:
If the content has been parsed before that structure should be reusable.
Parsing is a means to split content pieces and map into a larger work, however
it is somewhat error prone and unnecessary if the application has to parse the content anyway.

Parsing really should not be in the renderer at all, as it analyses semantic information to create
new partials.
If it is not in the render function, then it should be part of the toolset.

For some things parseland is necessary:
Example: When maintaining an FAQ:
Maintaining question and answer mappings in data is cumbersome,
because of additional syntax and not that good human readability.

The best solution would be to put questions and answers into a markdown
file (medium sized file with titles for questions and paragraphs between for answers)
and to parse titles and paragraphs and make them 'question-answer' containers.

Though instead of considering them content - parse - reorder,
we can instead say that a **data extraction** is performed on the content
and if we create a component renderer **question-answer** we could use this DATA
to inflate the component through a normal renderer.

What we need?
- What we want to extract and how?
- Where we want the extracted data to go (component renderer)
- Which component is chosed for which data (how is the data bound and selected)
- Where do we want to fully rendered components to appear

FAQ:
- What: titles and paragraphs -> 



### Prevent branching logic
Instead go for mappings/bindings


### Content centric
Ideally every piece of data can be defined through content
in markdown (reduced rich text format)


#### Structured data:
Data should be readable structured and you should make out how it is defined.
With minimal decoration for data transformation


#### Navigation
---
subrender: 
    urlcomponent: ../example/myurlrenderer.ts
    mdbullet: ../example/markdown-bullet-point-renderer.ts
#nav: filter((item, index) => index < 5 &&  )

- ayakraft
    - √úber uns >> furl >> navlink
    - Team  >> furl >> navlink
    - overview >> get-all-items >> sort date >> get-items(5) >> urlcomponent

- articles
    - articles >> get-all >> sort date asc >> get-items(8) >> mdbullet

- music
    - Instrumente dec(url="/instrumente") bind('urlcomponent')
    

{{ get('music') | filter(n = 5, date = asc) | bind('urlcomponent') }}
{{ get('overview') | filter(n = 5, date = asc) | bind('urlcomponent') }}

`other layout.ts:`
content >> filter html titles >> select-decendants(level=1) >> furlget >> decorate-with-url

Another example:

- ayakraft
    - √úber uns `findurl(this)`
    - [√úber uns](`findurl(img.label)`)
    - √úber uns `define navtext | mdlink | findurl(navtext)`
    - Team `findurl(this) | create('navlink')`
    - overview `md(this) | create('navlink')`    >> get-all-items >> sort date >> get-items(5) >> urlcomponent
    - overview ``get-tag-items | sort('date') | slice(0,5) | create('navlink') | passprint(`rendered navlink: ${mydefinedvar}`) ``
    - Overview
        - ``get-tag-items('overview') | sort('date') | slice(0,5) | create('navlink') | passprint(`rendered navlink: ${mydefinedvar}`) ``

`yml`
- ayakraft
    - √úber uns
    - Team
    - Overview
        tag: 'overview'
        sort: 'date'
        items: [0, 5]
`/yml`




    Evaluate this as pure markdown (no evaluated code just passing the wrapped text to markdown)
    `md`
        ```bash
            echo "I am some markdown code block"
        ```
    `/md`

    `print``[someurl](http://some.com)`

    `tem('mdurl')`
        - [item.name](item.url)
    `/tem`


    `each sortedItems`
        - [`item.name`](`item.url`)
    `/each`

    `import('somelib.ts')`


    `templateEach(sortedItems, mdurl, 'item')`
    `mdurl(sortedItems)`


    `js`
        `print('[someurl](http://some.com)')`
    `/js`


    - Overview
        ```
        function mdTagLinks(tag, amount){
            const tagItems = get-tag-items(tag);
            const sortedItems = sort('date').slice(0,amount || 5);

            sortedItems.map((item) => create('navlink'))
            

            printEach(sortedItems, 
                (item) => {
                    print('-');
                    print(create('navlink', item));
                }
            )

            templateEach('- `create('navlink', item)`', sortedItems)
            templateEach(sortedItems)
                (create('navlink', item))
                ('- item')

            //For small things like this a component is a bit overkill ->
            const outTemplate = compile('- [name](url)')

            '- [name](url)'.compile().mapFor(sortedItems)

            sortedItems.map(outTemplate)

            '- [name](url)'.inflate(sortedItems).io(item, { name, url })

        }

        get-tag-items('overview') | sort('date') | slice(0,5) | create('navlink') | passprint(`rendered navlink: ${mydefinedvar}`) 
        ```

`code`

`endcode`


Even better: Don't bind to 'urlcomponent' yet -> only insert markdown and add calculated data 
and collection data as md decoration.
Through this we can print the compiled markdown formatted content, 
in very human readable form (html is less readable and contains lots of meta information - types of elements/tags - display properties,attributes)
Html is not a pure data format + has lots of explicit semantics that decorate the data without being dependant on it
and would be better added when actually creating the html document (markdown to html render step).



## Generic language decorator ('enhancer'/ inflator)

The markup language (or config or style, etc.) to javascript interface should not be dependant on
the structure and syntax of the markup language.
Through this we can use it for different syntax (yml, json, css, html, markdown, xml)

Plugin for each language, but the runner and scope manager stays the same.
Each plugin adds the way in which inline js is specified (javascript context start/end tokens).
And the specific interface between language syntax and the javascript code.






## Configuration system:

1. Run application
2. Parse arguments
3. Set up configuration defaults (not instantiation yet)
4. Run custom config
5. Instantiate configuration
6. Run 2nd stage config (online Instances can be modified -> prevent monkey patching for non configurable params)
7. Perform target operation

## Runner chain:

At the end of the runner chain the input component should represent html.

Example markdown:
1. Compile to html
2. Resolve html based extended template syntax (njk, ehtml, liquid)
3. Check if there are unresolved features that identify a certain syntax / template language/system
4. If there are repeat at 2. until everything is done

Maybe add a data property:
```
runnerChain: 
compileRunners: md njk ehtml
```

for a file type it should be possible to define a default set of compile chains to use.
maybe don't allow jumping around to different syntax types willfully and instead
enforce usage of pseudo runner components (\<\njk><\md><\yml>) for these uses
(the component/template has to indicate the runner to evaluate a block in, instead of the runners detecting unresolved syntax)


## Imports:
- Enforce import referencing by file name  no matter the platform (ehtml, njk, md, ts)

```
const for = getComponent('for')
for.render(Object.assign({{}, data, it: 'tag', of: 'tagList'}))

renderComponent('for', {it: 'tag', of: 'tagList'} , data)
# should be universal components, that can be used from any platform


```
