    I a real website you probably would not make an document contains a single 'content-page' only, but instead would 
    do these in bulk for a category/tag or the whole website.

    If you only need 1 page combined with a parent, just import the layout and pass the contents as a body, no additional assembly file necessary.
    Though the main component (for compiling the website) would need to then import the `content piece` and render it as a page to the output dir.
